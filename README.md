                I used what I found here in my code

        https://github.com/Mckinsey666/bullet
                I used what I found here to manage the inputs

                Note that you will have to pip this library

                One more thing, bullet requires you to run this in linux, macos, or in a windows app which provides a vt100-like window (WLS for example)
